# IEMS Assignment 1
Finding abnormal cluster (outlier) to identify rooms for improvements in Medicare's service and fairness

## How to run 
* Download [Medicare_Provider_Util_Payment_PUF_CY2017.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FlrzgC0vUllsfoEICzo0uMmHzFnBGlxG/view?usp=sharing) and [converted.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TgXTiDHi7rL6RSiGCl-GDNa3YSHb7yG1/view?usp=sharing). Put those file in data folder. I could not push those files because the file size of those files exceeded the github limit. 
* Open source_code.ipynb file and run each code snippet. I recommend this way than running source_code.py
* Or run source_code.py.

### Prerequisites
* Python (numpy, pandas, csv, copy, sklearn, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn)
* Tableau

### What file to check for what
On Canvas announcement, it says that we need to submit 4 things. 
* The source code: check "source_code.ipynb" or "source_code.py". I recommend source code.ipynb because it is easier to read.
* Sample output of the code (as text file): Check "data/clustered_data.csv" or "data/clustered_data.txt". I recommend CSV file because it is more structured
* A half a page 'executive summary' of the findings: Check "Executive Summary.pdf"
* Document with all findings: Check "Report.pdf"
